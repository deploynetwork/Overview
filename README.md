# Overview
### Decentralized platform enabling on demand deployment of P2P network protocols.</h3>
With increasing exposure of Blockchain technologies, users migrate to centralized keystores, and developers use centralized network endpoints. On January 3rd, 2019 there was a movement to move funds off of centralized exchanges and into wallets that provided users with their keys. In the same week, there were various discussions on Twitter about the nearly (at the time of writing) 137GB Ethereum mainnet chain, and how it was becoming difficult for a user to sustain running their own node. And, to top it off, with an impending hard-fork to a Proof of Authority mainnet, demand for running your own node continues to rise.

While existing node deployment services exist such as [QuikNode](https://quiknode.io/) for cloud-deployments, and [Avado](https://ava.do/) for physical nodes, each had their own detriment. Hence, Deploy Network was devised as a solution to the problems associated with running your own nodes (costs, maintenance, convenience), while staying open-source and 'pseudo-decentralized'.
